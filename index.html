                        Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Christopher Said and I am so glad that you have found your
                        way
                        here. On this site you will find my work in various disciplines and some background on who I am
                        as a
                        person. My journey to this point has been a long and complex one, but in software, I feel that I
                        have finally found what I will do for the rest of my life.
                        <br><br>
                        At the moment I am a web development and programming student. That would be the "dev" in design
                        and
                        dev. However, my education spans many subjects and changes of plans. I started out studying
                        journalism in an honors program. From there I transferred to a Bible college where I studied
                        theology and missions work. It was there that my mind was wired for deep logic. I wrote many
                        long
                        papers where I had to synthesize sources to craft an argument. In a lot of ways, just like code!
                        After three years there, there was a life change which led me into the workforce before deciding
                        to
                        go back to college. This time I studied graphic design and photography and dabbled in web. That
                        would be the "design" in design and dev. But, the farther I got along in my studies, the more I
                        realized that my heart was drawn to code, where logic and creativity meet! I switched my program
                        and
                        have been loving it since!
                        <br><br>
                        I am looking forward to putting the varied and fascinating skills I have learned over the years
                        to
                        use for an employer or client now! I don't know everything there is to know about this field,
                        but I
                        have learned that I am close to reaching the limit on the benefit that I can derive from a
                        classroom. So please, look around this site and let me know if you would like me to design and
                        develop for you!

                        Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Christopher Said, a web development and programming student with a
                        diverse educational background that spans journalism, theology, and graphic design. My journey
                        has been one of discovery, starting with an honors program in journalism, followed by theology
                        and missions work, which honed my logical thinking. Later, I explored graphic design and
                        photography, but my passion for coding, where logic meets creativity, led me to switch to web
                        development. I’m eager to apply the varied skills I’ve gained over the years for clients or
                        employers. Feel free to explore my work and reach out!
