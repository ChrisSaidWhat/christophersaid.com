                <p>
                    There is currently no legislation, anywhere in the country, that can protect
                    Koalas and Koala habitat in Australia.
                    The listing of the koala as &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; under the Environmental Protection and
                    Biodiversity Conservation Act in 2012 changed nothing.
                    This is supposed to be the premier law for protecting Australia's environment,
                    yet it is powerless.
                    By the time you read this page the bulldozers may already be working, but it is
                    not too late to take action.
                    To the right we have listed some of the things that might make a difference.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Plant Koala food trees. Don't forget out find out which kinds of gum trees are the
                            favorites
                            of
                            Koalas in your area.
                        </li>
                        <li>When out driving, ask your family and friends to be very careful not to hit wildlife
                            crossing
                            roads, especially at night.
                            Remember, Koalas are most active at night.
                        </li>
                        <li>Keep your dogs your cats inside at night, to protect all wildlife.</li>
                        <li>If you have a swimming pool, place a sturdy rope into the pool attached to a tree or
                            post at
                            the
                            edge,
                            so that if Koalas fall into your pool, they are able to climb out safely.
