                                    <p>
                                        I was tasked with creating a fully functional prototype for a website redesign
                                        using
                                        Adobe XD. I chose a website that has been deeply impactful to me but lacked
                                        stellar
                                        design. I began by creating a moodboard to nail down the style I was going for.
                                        I decided to create a vintage feel with a subtle paper texture background and a
                                        hand sketched aesthetic. I combined this with a color palette of beige, muted
                                        purple, and off-black. I chose this due to purple's associations with the mind.
                                        The combination of muted tones and the beige create the desired effect of
                                        calming the visitor to the site. These choices were made to accomplish the
                                        purpose of the site as set out by its owner.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        After making decisions from the moodboard, I designed the information
                                        architecture for the site and laid it out in a flow chart. Then I moved to draft
                                        a design proposal including the process, the direction chosen, the timeline, and
                                        the price. Finally, I began to layout the design in Adobe XD. To save time, I
                                        made good use of Adobe Firefly to generate images matching the style I selected
                                        for the website. From there I took the generated images into Adobe Illustrator
                                        and made any necessary changes.

                                        designing a website for. Once I had determined the history, mission, goals, and
                                        brand of this hypothetical client, I started sketching potential wireframes.
                                        From here I created a moodboard to finalize the direction I wanted the visuals
                                        to take. I chose to go in the direction of a modern and minimalist theme for the
                                        site. As such images would have a grainy, lo-fi effect on them and the color
                                        palette I chose consisted of neutrals with a green to offset. A design proposal
                                        was then drafted identifying these things and offering a timeline and cost.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        From that point, I began to implement the specifics into the basic wireframe
                                        that I had built by finding and generating images and adjusting them as needed
                                        in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I also used ChatGPT to generate the
                                        copy for this site according to my specific promptings. I used my knowledge of
                                        typography to find fonts that would also match the theming and brand voice that
                                        I had created. Finally, I added basic functionality to the wireframe, turning it
                                        into a prototype.

                                        I was given the brand name LegenDairy, a vegan cheese company, and a design
                                        brief that required me to make reference to a mythical creature in the logo
                                        design. From there I began to sketch out the ideas that came to me. I settled on
                                        the concept of a fairy milkmaid as I felt that it conveyed the concept of a
                                        cheese having magical properties, as it was not made from milk, yet still having
                                        a handmade, quality, human touch to it. I customized a typeface that was already
                                        rounded and conveyed a sense of fluidity to it so as to accentuate the friendly
                                        and natural feel of the brand. It also was a nod to the missing milk. I chose
                                        colors that would evoke a vintage feel and cause the consumer to think back to
                                        an old farm and the milkman.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        With all of this decided, I put it together in my vector illustration program. I
                                        also used mockups to create packaging for the brand. The colors were customized
                                        for each type of cheese. I finished the process with the creation of a style
                                        guide which formalizes how the various assets should be used in relation to each
                                        other. It includes a type scale and the official color palette with the color
                                        codes.

                                        This project called for the creation of a die-cut invitation to the grand
                                        opening of a new art house. What is featured here is the social media
                                        advertisement for Facebook that would accompany physical invitations which would
                                        be sent out. I decided to feature one of the pieces of art that was in the
                                        physical invitation prominently on the ad. Using Adobe InDesign, I was quickly
                                        able to make several variations of the ad for LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter.

                                        This project entailed designing a book from the ground up. I was given the text
                                        of the Brothers Grimm completely unformatted and had to format every sentence,
                                        paragraph, and page so that it would be legible, attractive, and intuitive. I
                                        also was tasked with designing the cover and spine of the book. I decided to
                                        design the book in the style of a modernized illuminated medieval manuscript.
                                        The assets on the cover were created using Adobe Firefly and then brought into
                                        Adobe Illustrator for significant fine tuning. I then took pieces from the cover
                                        and incorporated throughout the pages of the book as a means of tying it
                                        together as a cohesive whole.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Professional book design decisions were made for this work. You will notice that
                                        each paragraph meets the next without a space. This is because indents were
                                        selected to denote the beginning of each paragraph. In professional printing,
                                        you can select one method or the other, but not both. Also of note is the
                                        colophon designed to look like a Turnip. This is an homage to the typeface used
                                        for both its legibility and old European flair, Turnip.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The layout had to be done with printing in mind. The finished manuscript and
                                        cover design were sent off to a professional printer so that a physical copy
                                        could be made. This means that each measurement had to be precise and exact or
                                        the entire work could have been destroyed. It was executed precisely right and
                                        printed as intended. The PDF version of the book can be viewed by clicking

                                        In this project, many assets were provided in advance, as was the copy. This was
                                        mostly an exercise in playing with color, type, and one fantastically high
                                        resolution photo of a wine glass. The visual arrangement of elements in this
                                        trifold allow each to evoke a sense of elegance and sophistication fitting of
                                        the Napa Valley wine tasting experience. I used Adobe InDesign to arrange the
                                        pieces and fine tune the typography. InDesign was also used to place where the
                                        folds would need to go for the printed brochure.

                                    <p>
                                        Once the design was complete in InDesign, I had to adjust the print settings and
                                        ensure that the document printed correctly. From there I proceeded to take the
                                        printed version and utilized special tools to ensure a perfect crease on each
                                        fold line. The PDF version can be viewed below, however, it does not appear as a
                                        trifold because much of that exists in the printing settings.

                                        This project was a blast! I was instructed to randomly generate a 3-5 word title
                                        for a Netflix show. I received “Admiration for the Robotic Police” back from the
                                        generator. I envisioned it as a dystopian sci-fi political action thriller. I
                                        used Adobe Firefly to generate the background image. As it was an earlier
                                        version of that program, the image came out a bit distorted and malformed. I
                                        believe that actually adds to the effect it has. It creates the eerie and
                                        unsettled atmosphere that I had desired. The way it both intently stares at the
                                        title while also staring blankly off into space highlights the impression that
                                        this is a soulless and emotionless automaton.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Once the image was chosen and placed, I set about designing the title treatment.
                                        I chose a font that felt futuristic but also playful to be ironic. I found some
                                        icons and colorized them and merged them with the stems of letters that I
                                        extended to turn into flag poles. This was done to highlight the political
                                        aspect of the show. With that, the project was done and communicated all the
                                        messages that I wanted the title card to get across to the viewer. These Netflix
                                        title cards only have a short moment to convince a viewer to click on it and get
                                        more information, which is something I feel this design effectively
                                        accomplishes.

                                        This was one of my favorite design projects that I have done. It is an
                                        exploration of typographic voice, using fonts to convey different emotions, by
                                        designing album covers for different genres. However, I was given boundaries to
                                        work within. I got a random photo and a random title. I had to use the same
                                        photo and title for all the different genres, but I could edit the photo however
                                        I wanted and I was required to use different fonts for each genre. The point is
                                        that by simply using a different typeface, an entirely different emotion can be
                                        conveyed to the viewer. The four genres are classical, country, rock, and
                                        techno. The PDF displays them in that order.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For the classical album, I chose an art deco font for the label and a basic
                                        script font for the title to convey elegance and harken back to a prior time.
                                        The photo of a glass which I was given, I then chopped up into four pieces and
                                        rotated each in different direction. Next, I added grain to the pieces and
                                        overlaid it all in a calming blue. This creates a tension between dissonance and
                                        consonance. There is both a calming in the font and color, but a tension in the
                                        random rotation and broken up images now made grainy.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For the country album, I chose a rough, textured font for the label and a
                                        handwriting based script font for the title. The photo of the glass is left
                                        unaltered for the most part. This is to communicate the simplicity of the
                                        country man. The text of the title has been adjusted to meet the curve of the
                                        liquid in the glass. This draws the eye to the liquid and makes the viewer
                                        question what the contents of the glass really are.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For the rock album, I chose a font that puts each letter at a different size and
                                        hight so that nothing really lines up. For the title I chose a very punchy yet
                                        squat, all caps font. The image is flipped upside down and the highlights are
                                        turned up. All is overlaid in red. This all comes together to make it feel like
                                        the whole composition is in ordered disarray and being compressed in emotion and
                                        anger
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        For the techno album, I chose a font that is very angular and futuristic for the
                                        label and a pixel based bitmap font for the title as direct throwback to the old
                                        days of computing. The image of the glass as been warped and distorted so that
                                        the glass now looks like sound waves. All of it is overlaid with a green that is
                                        reminiscent of a hacker’s screen.

                                    <p>
                                        This is the capstone website for my Web Development AAS which demonstrates the
                                        technical ability I possess in a wide array of technical coding and web design.
                                        It incorporates both front end and back end technologies and it features a live
                                        connection to a database which the site dynamically displays content from. The
                                        site features an admin section where new recipes can be added to the database to
                                        display on the front end. This all happens dynamically each time the site is
                                        loaded. It also features many forms and pages that update according to user
                                        input. The site communicates back and forth by sending data in JSON and then
                                        decoding it between PHP and JavaScript respectively. The PHP contains prepared
                                        statements to access the MySQL database that underpins the whole site. The site
                                        also performs CRUD operations, allowing full admin control from the website
                                        while logged in without the need to visit a hosting account control panel. The
                                        visuals of the site feature complex animations and provide ample user feedback.
                                        There is also a Git repo that contains all the PHP code. This can be found by
                                        clicking the GitHub logo in the footer.

                                        This WordPress website was a demonstration of mastery over the WooCommerce
                                        plugin. I was given free reign in the content, design, and functionality of the
                                        site. However, the site was required to implement Stripe in test mode so that it
                                        could have full e-commerce functionality. The site also calculates sales tax and
                                        applies it at checkout. There are discounts and coupon codes implemented as
                                        well. Cross-sells and upsells are also present in some of items. I decided to
                                        design it in such a way as to accentuate the premium feel via muted colors and a
                                        minimal theme.

                                        This site is the final project for my WordPress course. It encompasses all the
                                        skills that I learned that semester. Of course, since then my abilities have
                                        grown through my freelance work. For this site, I was required to build a site
                                        for a game development conference. This was chosen to maximize the types of
                                        content I would have to consider in my design of the site to maximize usability.
                                        There were events that had to have details and be part of the overall conference
                                        schedule. The speakers had to be listed out. There were various registration
                                        forms with conditional logic that had to be built. An e-commerce portion had to
                                        exist to support a merch store. This required WooCommerce with full Stripe test
                                        mode. Widgets were used to increase the ease of navigation so the user did not
                                        have to go through the
                                        menu to find the page where information was located. Instead the information
                                        would come to the user. The provided graphics for the project were not very
                                        pleasing to look at, so I took it on myself to attempt to create all the
                                        graphics on the site using
                                        Adobe Firefly and then editing what was required. To go with the game
                                        development topic, I designed the site around the black and green hacker screens
                                        you seen in the movies and for the images, pixel art was the jumping off point
                                        to bring to mind the childhood Nintendo games we all played.
